# Light-it Challenge

I enjoyed doing the challenge, hope you like the implementation.
As the challenge suggested, I used TailwindCSS and I tried to be as accurrate as possible with the design (except some simplifications done for prioritizing other things). Create-react-app was used as a starter toolkit

## Start instructions: 
- Clone the repo
- go to lightit-challenge and run npm install
- once installation finished run npm start

For time reasons I simplified a coumple of css things. This was my first time working with TailwindCSS
